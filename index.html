				<h2>About Me</h2>
			</header>

			<p>
				Hi there! My name is Joel Richards, and I'm currently a first-year Computer Science student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I'm originally from Truro, Nova Scotia, but live in Halifax during the school year. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I personally see myself as a lifetime learner. One of the things I enjoy doing the most is learning about technologies, whether they be new or old. I find a lot of joy in looking at technology news to find a topic that I find interesting, and then reading everything available about that topic. I find that doing this has significantly improved my knowledge of the world as it becomes increasingly more technologically-focused, and I intend on continuing to do so as time goes on.
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of my academic interests, I am very interested in computer science, math and physics. I'm a problem solver, which makes studying these topics very enjoyable. Like with general technology, I often find myself reading about new things in these fields in my free time, trying to absorb as much as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not doing work or studying, I love to play sports and some video games. Tennis is my main passion, and I play it as much as I possibly can. This has likely resulted from me working at a local tennis club for the past few years, fully immersing me in the sport and the culture. I also play soccer for fun with friends, as soccer is something that I have enjoyed playing for as long as I can remember. In terms of video games, I primarily play FPSes like Counter Strike and Call of Duty, but I also games like Mario Tennis Aces and Smash Bros with friends.

					<h3>Research: The Math Behind RSA</h3>

					<p>
						In high school, I researched the mathematics behind the RSA cryptographic algorithm. At the time, I had little to no experience in computer science, so the paper primarily focuses on the mathematics that go into the algorithm. Included are explanations for all of the necessary functions used in generating RSA keys, as well as a walkthrough of key generation and usage.

					<h3>Coding: RSA in Python</h3>

					<p>
						After starting university and becoming more familiar with Python as my first programming language, I decided that I would take the knowledge gained from writing my paper on the RSA algorithm and try and implement the same functionality in Python. The program generates an RSA keypair using two prime numbers entered by the user. I tried to write the program so that it followed the process outlined in the paper as closely as possible. The program can be found <a href="https://www.github.com/brownloki">on my GitHub profile.</a>

					<h3>Design: Graphic Design</h3>

						I occasionally put the skills I gained from a digital arts course I took in high school to use in designing logos and other images for myself and friends. The one in the header of the page is the one I use personally on platforms like Steam, and the one below is something I put together for a group of friends. You can find some of them on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r6xqTS4_n6OAUvRk1w00DgvsTNi4RfR8">my Google Drive</a>
